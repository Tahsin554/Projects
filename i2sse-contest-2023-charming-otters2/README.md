## User Manual or Instructions

#### Step 1: Opening the file
To use this program, Isaacs Oscillating Money, first you need to open the Final v1 folder. Inside there, open up the Newton_Client folder. From there double click the Newton_Client.pde file. This will open up processing. 

#### Step 2: Running the program
Once you are in processing, press the play button in the top left corner to start the program. When the program opens, you should see an image of Isaac Newton moving across the screen repeatedly. There should be an ATM displayed on the right-hand side and apples should be falling in the background behind all the other objects. 

#### Step 3: Playing the game
Once the program is running, you can use the mouse click to make Isaac Newton's arms move. If newton is close enough to the ATM, the ATM screen will light up and display the oscillating money.
